_MuleSoft Certified_

The MarkLogic MuleSoft Connector aims to provide the MuleSoft community of users (via the MuleSoft Anypoint Exchange) with easy integration to MarkLogic, delivering data movement and transformation pipelines via MuleSoft AnypointStudio and Design Center flows. The MuleSoft Connector is built atop MarkLogic’s https://developer.marklogic.com/learn/data-movement-sdk/[Data Movement SDK] (DMSDK), which is a Java API library for applications that need to move data into, out of, or within a MarkLogic cluster.  For those familiar with the existing MarkLogic ecosystem, it provides the core capabilities of MarkLogic Content Pump in the vernacular of the MarkLogic Java Client API.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with the following Mule concepts: Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio or Design Center, Mule flows, and Mule Global Elements.  It also assumes familiarity with the following MarkLogic concepts: MarkLogic Java Client API, Data Movement SDK, and REST APIs. 

See the Release Notes for compatibility information listed in the See Also section of this document.

== What's New in this Connector

=== Version 1.1.1 - 2020-05-11

Release 1.1.1 provides:

* A bugfix, to allow one to peform a query to retrieve a consistent, point-in-time snapshot of documents coming out of MarkLogic.  
* A bugfix to allow for execution of MarkLogic server-side transforms at the operation level, with improved transformation parameter handling.
* A bugfix to allow server-side Search API options files to work correctly when using RawStructuredQueryType queries.
* Improved ability to work with consistent point-in-time snapshot queries for MarkLogic egress operations.
* Improved ability to work with server-side transformations at the operation level.
* Improved output and pagination functionality, for egress-centric operations, including more advanced mimetype and document type recognition for use with Mule flow messaging.
* Renamed internal classes to reflect MuleSoft certification best practices.
* Improved egress operations by allowing for specification of pagination length, and max results returned.
* TLS context initialization improvements, to reflect MuleSoft certification best practices.
* Updated documentation, moving some non-required Markdown documents out of source control, and into GitHub wiki pages.
* Applied increased usage of Enumerations on connection and configuration parameters, plus operations, to provide better UI inputs for Anypoint Studio and Anypoint Design Center.

=== Version 1.1.0 - 2019-06-30

Release 1.1.0 adds:

* Operations for queryDocs (which deprecates operation selectDocsByStructuredQuery) and deleteDocs.
* Updates documentation and tests.
* Refer to the <<"MarkLogic Module Documentation Reference">> section below for details.

=== Version 1.0.0 - 2019-01-18

This is the initial release of the Connector, so, everything's new!

* Added operations for importDocs, getJobReport, and retrieveInfo.
* Provided documentation of configuration and example flows demonstrating importDocs and getJobReport operations.

== To Connect in Design Center

There are two options for installing and running the 1.1.1 demo flow in Design Center.

1. Deploying the demo flow directly to CloudHub and Anypoint Design Center, from Anypoint Studio.
2. Exporting a JAR of the demo from Anypoint Studio, for import into Design Center.

=== Deploying from Anypoint Studio Directly to CloudHub and Design Center

. After installing the 1.1.1 demo in Anypoint Studio, deploy the application directly to CloudHub by selecting the 1.1.1 demo in the Project Explorer.  Then, right-click, and select "Anypoint Platform&rarr;Deploy to CloudHub".
. Continue to authenticate to Design Center and CloudHub, and follow the steps.

=== Importing a JAR to Design Center

. From Anypoint Studio, export a JAR of the demo 1.1.1 application by right-clicking the application name in Project Explorer, and selecting "Export".
. Keep the default selections.
. Choose the filesystem location to save the JAR and click "Finish".  The JAR should now reside on your filesystem at the chosen location.
. Login to Anypoint Design Center.
. Go to Runtime Manager in order to test the demo application. Select an environment. The default Sandbox environment will suffice.
. In the Deploy Application screen, provide an application name, and specify the demo jar file to be uploaded for deployment.
. This will deploy the application onto CloudHub by default. Select Runtime Version 4.2.2, with default worker size and workers.
. Press the "Deploy Application" button. 
. Track deployment and application process by clicking the "Logs" button in the Applications screen.
. The demo application is the same as used and described in the Anypoint Studio 7 sections detailed below.

image::designcenter-staging-deploy.png[Deploy Demo App]

=== Use the Connector in a Flow

. To use the MarkLogic Connector in a flow, go to Design Center, and create a new project (or open an existing one).
. Edit or create the flow according to details described below in the Anypoint Studio 7 sections.
. The MarkLogic Connector is searchable and able to be applied to the flow. Apply the operation of interest to add it to the flow.

image::designcenter-flow-2.png[Select MarkLogic Operations]

=== Triggers
* The demo uses the built-in MuleSoft HTTP listener as a trigger to begin the flow sequence. 

=== Test the Connector

An HTTP request to http://{cloudhub-created-host}8081/exportDocs will run the demo.

See Example section below for how to execute a test of a flow from the demo app.

== To Install this Connector in Anypoint Studio 7

In order to use the connector, create a new, empty Mule project in AnyStudio with:

* File -> New -> Mule Project

You're now ready to install the Connector as a Maven dependency for your project.  Right- or Ctrl-click on your project name in the Package Explorer.

To do this in the editor, use these screenshots as a guide, making sure to add the Connector jar as a local dependency:

image::mule-add-dependency.png[Add Maven Dependency]

Use "Install a local dependency", and add the Connector .jar file from the *target/* directory on your filesystem.

image::add-dependency-local.png[Add local Maven Dependency]

You can optionally or alternatively add this dependency as an Artifact Definition:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>com.marklogic</groupId>
  <artifactId>marklogic-mule-connector</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

*Important Note*: You may need to install additional dependencies and update the list of Maven repositories.  For example, in the MarkLogic Java API and Data Movement SDK libraries, the current okhttp-digest library version is 1.15.  Several developers working on this project have needed to additionally include 1.16 in the Mule project dependencies while using AnypointStudio.  To find it, the JCenter repository needed adding to the pom.xml under the Mule project tree.  

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<repository>
  <id>jcenter</id>
  <url>http://jcenter.bintray.com</url>
</repository>
----

== To Create a Mule Project in Anypoint Studio 7

. As described above in the section entitled "To Install this Connector in Anypoint Studio 7", create a new Mule Project and install the MarkLogic Mule Connector dependency.

=== To Create a Mule Project Using XML

. As described above in the section entitled "To Install this Connector in Anypoint Studio 7", create a new Mule Project and install the MarkLogic Mule Connector dependency.

. Next, right- or Ctrl-click the project at left in the Project Explorer view of Anypoint Studio. 

. Select File -> New -> Mule Configuration File.

image::flow-xml-new.png[New Flow XML]

. Provide a name for your Mule flow.  It will automatically populate the name of the Flow XML.

image::flow-xml-naming.png[Flow XML Naming]

. In the main window section, find the link for "Configuration XML". Copy and paste the following into the XML editor, then save (overwriting the existing XML). 

*Note:* You'll need to update your MarkLogic credentials to write the Zip contents to your local MarkLogic.

=== To Run and Test a Mule Flow

See the demo instructions below to run and test a Mule flow.

== Example: MarkLogic Mule Connector exportDocs

This example demonstrates the use of the MarkLogic Mule Connector, doing the following:

. Creating an HTTP listener that accepts an HTTP GET request at /exportDocs as our trigger.
. Formulates a MarkLogic StructuredQuery within the exportDocs operation, specifying a maximum result count of 12 documents, against the "employees" collection of documents persisted in MarkLogic.
. MarkLogic returns the JSON document content, and places them into JSON response payload via the MuleSoft Transform operation and DataWeave code for satifying the user's HTTP request.  
. The JSON response format is as follows:
